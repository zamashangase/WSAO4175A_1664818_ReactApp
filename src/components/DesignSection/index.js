According to colour psychology, different colours have a different representation and effect in terms of branding.
The colour pink represents compassion, softness and creativity. I thought it would be fitting since the website focuses
on different aspects of internet art including internet art blog posts such as web net and the design section showing
the design process. It is used for the background colour to show a bit of softness and safety for the viewers and creativity.
The colour black is seen as professional, elegance and a symbol of power. It was chosen for the header to give off a sense of professionalism
and elegance as well as compliment the softness of the pink background. It is also seen as formal as it gives this view for the website.
The black font is commonly used for articles and paragraphs in websites.
The colour white represents calmness, neatiness and tidiness. This colour was selected for the header font links to show the tidiness of the website
and viewers are able to see the links clearly and the colour does not conflict with any colours in the website.
Lastly the colour purple which is seen when selecting different links in the header have a different colour psychological view 
on the website as the professionalism of this colour shows luxury, ambition and confidence.

  The homepage has been replaced with the internet artwork that I created because the internet artwork is a part of the creative component of the
  website and it compliments the website being an artwork piece itself. Unlike the first website for Assignment 1 the navbar and header has been changed to 
  different colour to compliment the shades and visual representation of the internet artwork which is a sea of colours.
  there is a techincal issue where there is a box showing that the internet artwork is on the Home Page but it is not visual reflecting and showing
  right now it is a bit difficult to make the artwork interactive. My wireframes are in the assets folder of the app and it has been imported but for some 
  reason it is not showing but it is available in the assets folder. This is also the same problem with final style guide.
  The style guide is the same because the some of the colours are still on the colour scheme and therefore can be still available.
  Also the colour theme of the artwork is based on auras and the final style guide can be seen as a part of the artwork throughout
  the website using the waves and circles of pink. I also like how the background image of the style guide also has circles just like aura patterns.
  This fills in nicely with the internet artwork aura theme being seen throughout the website.
  The reference material in the preparatory work were used for layouts and app designs but it's har implementing them right now so my app layout is simple for now 
  so the blogposts information is easily readable and the design section is also accesible as well as the homepage and internet artwork section.
  The reference material also inspired the header and semantic markups of all the pages as the titles are seen on the header and the page continues 
  from there and the space for the navbar looks like a corner navbar.
