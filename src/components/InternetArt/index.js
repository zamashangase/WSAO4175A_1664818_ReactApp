            <h2>Final Internet Artwork Rationale and Critical Reflection</h2>

            <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
 I call my Final artwork Aura Moon. This uses Aura inspired internet artworks as a source of inspiration.
  The subjects of the internet artwork are the white orbs with the pink spots.
 The first top waves are different shades of purple representing the night sky.
  The middle pink patterns with different shades of pinks represents the land. 
It is an elemental and spiritual inspired artwork.
            </p>
           <h3>Rationale:</h3>
           <p>
This final internet artwork of mine came out when researching aura internet artwork. While 
researching different aura internet artwork I noticed that these patterns have a elemental
feel towards them. For example an art piece on aura can have waves which has
a water elemental feel which inspired the thought for my previous internet art 
prototype.The circles of aura art has an air type of feel. The top waves were inspired by 
wave aura artwork and the Northern Lights. The dark shades of purple are to give it a night type of feel.

 The pink shades of the internet art is land and is supposed to have a little rhythmetical pattern. 
  The elemental feel it is supposed to give is Earth which is why I chose the light pink shades so 
  it does not blend with the purple shades.
  The star or subject of the internet art are the white orbs in the middle of the artwork. This was chosen to represent the lunar phases of the moon.
  The whole inspiration for this artwork is the aura internet artworks but I incorporated something different  by giving using the
  lines for different subjects and different waves. The night sky patterns evolved from my preparatory artwork
  of the ocean and the white orbs evolved from the circles in the prorotype and I turned them into the moon because the moon is usually
  associated with ocean. I wanted a universal feel to my artwork which was inspired the auras by giving it an aura but not giving the same 
  type of artworks you find in aura internet artwork.
           </p>
           <h3>Reflection:</h3>
           <p>
               In terms of succeeding I believe this artwork does make use of the subject of using lines and shapes to reate an art piece with an 
               aura or spiritual feel which I got from one of readings about visual representation and getting feeling towards the artwork so it feelings
               like an art piece. The use of circles are also unique because most aura artworks souly focuses on the circle as an aura whereas I wanted more 
               than that I wanted people to be like "What is so special about these white orbs?" Which is why after looking to evolving my original prototype.
               I thought different spiritual beliefs such as Thh Moon being connected to the sea. Also white orbs can also be used to represent souls which is a part
               of spiritual research. Also the moon is ususally linked to femininity traits in spiritual beliefs and sme religious cultures. An example I can give is 
               the Yin and Yang which country of origin is China. The moon is associated with women whereas the Sun is associated with men. 
           </p>
           <p>
            In terms of failing I feel like the interactivity as enhances as I wanted it to be because you can view it in full view and exit it when clicked but that is 
            the only interaction I could give and I was expecting it to cover the whole page when you solely view the internet artwork and you can exit it but it is still the
            same size. I am a bit of a perfectionist so I wasnt happy with how the lines were compared to the inspiration I took it from but I used Krita to design and create
            this art piece. I think some of the artitst used Photoshop. But I wanted it to be my own thing.
           </p>
           <h3>Research:</h3>
           <p>
            In terms of research I feel like the section of the source inspiration at the bottom covers how much I incorporated and planned this
            out. The website I came across about UX/UI design by Anton Nikolov can also be used for internet artwork because the same rules it uses for the 
            halo effect can be incorporated in a product. In this case the website and the internet artwork are the product and the senses
            are what attract the viewers to this. For example with my internet artwork piece the first sense that is triggered is Sight because the viewers
            are viewing the product to see how they feel about the visual presentation that I have displayed on the website. The
            other sense that is incorporated in this artwork is Touch although the viewer cannot physically touch the artwork they can
            interact with it by clicking the icon on the right of the image and view it in a different page by itself and chose when to exit 
            viewing the full display of the artwork. Also using one of the readings for my statment the internet artwork I made can be copied and 
            become a physical visual image of copied and printed then displayed somewhere else. There are a lot of aura artworks
            that look the same but have a different colour to them but give off a different feeling for different viewers. I am referring to Danae and Chatel's readings.(Danae & Chatel, 2019)
            The irony has to the theme is aura but one of the readings state that aura can be replaced once copied but we as artists can create something and'
            make something beautiful out of it in our own ways.

My internet artwork prototype is different shades of pink and different shades of purple coming together to create this piece. I created this piece using Krita the drawing app. I started with using light pinks and light purples for the ends of the two corners. But these lines and shades do not touch each other clash instead it is meeting a group of circles that were drawn using a messy brush. Each circle is in groups and in three different colours.
This artwork prototype functions as an artwork because it is inspired by the source inspiration of my internet artwork preparatory work. This different lines of pink and purple inspired this specific prototype but the lines I created has the intention to create different lines that look very similar to waves or look like waves in general. The reason behind this is the way waves have a calm effect and I wanted to implement that effect through different colours instead blue, so it is not too obvious and the prototype airs out a bit mystery. The colours do look a bit similar to the colours from the source of inspiration. The source of inspiration internet artworks reminded me of auras which is spiritual and calming and uses colours to give a calming effect to the mind. While researching auras I noticed that most of the artworks for auras are circles with one or two colours surrounding each other. With the idea of auras being drawn in circles the prototype artwork has circles which are in groups. One group are purple circles, and the other is a group of pink circles. The circles I created are actually bubbles which is why some of them are small and others ae big. The difference between these bubbles and the aura circles is that aura circles are usually one circle meanwhile the bubbles are meant to compliment the waves of the prototypes.
Drawing to the theoretical framework the prototype can be analyzed through an example of the net art from Rhizomeâ€™s website which is called the simple net art diagram which I researched on Week 2. (Rhizome, 2016)Just like this artwork, my prototype has the ability to be transferred from different types of technology such as laptops and cellphones. It can be viewed from the laptop through the website link and because it is saved on Krita as a png image therefore it has two different visual representations. A png image and interactive artwork on the react app. This prototype can be imported on the website, and it can be posted onto social media using the png image. The social media platforms I am referring to are Instagram and Twitter. Another form of visual representation is that the png image can be posted as a video on these social media platforms with music in the background. Internet artwork as no physical copy and therefore can have multiple copies once imported and posted on the internet. I state this because most artworks that are posted social media can be screenshotted and posted in different accounts for promotion and recognition depending on if those accounts give the right credits to the artists but I believe the cons of other accounts posting the png image of the internet artwork is that some accounts might take credit of the artwork which is why I believe is important to sign your artwork with a signature that you use. I believe that internet artwork does have an aura or sense of emotion to the viewer, but it can bring different effects. Internet art is considered a new form of artwork I state this because most artworks are easily accessed using technology such as laptops and cell phones.
 Because this prototype is only available on the react app and in the asset file of the react app folder in visual studio code it is not as easily accessible to the internet artworks as most are. According to Danae this author believes that the internet has a huge influence in our daily lives I believe in this statement because todayâ€™s generation finds different ways to use the internet to communicate with family and friends and meet strangers on social media platforms such as Instagram and twitter. But it is not just for communication. The internet is also used to keep up with the news around the world and it is also used to be aware of political, social, and economical views that are happening in the country. A few examples I can give of this is the KZN floods may people who have family or friends in the province of KwaZulu Natal are aware of the floods and because of the news on social media using the world wide web it will make people contact their loved ones. I believe that also influences the art world in different ways as people can use the web to find inspiration for their own artwork pieces and create new pieces. There is access to different drawing applications in order to create different artworks which can be considered a technical canvas for artists in the art world to draw on. 
Websites can be viewed as art galleries on the world wide web as well as use for artistic research and promotion.
