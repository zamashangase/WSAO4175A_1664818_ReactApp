           <h2>Internet Art Original Prototype:</h2>
           <h3>Description:</h3>
           <p>
           My internet artwork prototype is different shades of pink and different shades of purple coming together to create this piece. I created this piece using Krita the drawing app. I started with using light pinks and light purples for the ends of the two corners. But these lines and shades do not touch each other clash instead it is meeting a group of circles that were drawn using a messy brush. Each circle is in groups and in three different colours.
This artwork prototype functions as an artwork because it is inspired by the source inspiration of my internet artwork preparatory work. This different lines of pink and purple inspired this specific prototype but the lines I created has the intention to create different lines that look very similar to waves or look like waves in general. The reason behind this is the way waves have a calm effect and I wanted to implement that effect through different colours instead blue, so it is not too obvious and the prototype airs out a bit mystery. The colours do look a bit similar to the colours from the source of inspiration. The source of inspiration internet artworks reminded me of auras which is spiritual and calming and uses colours to give a calming effect to the mind. While researching auras I noticed that most of the artworks for auras are circles with one or two colours surrounding each other. With the idea of auras being drawn in circles the prototype artwork has circles which are in groups. One group are purple circles, and the other is a group of pink circles. The circles I created are actually bubbles which is why some of them are small and others ae big. The difference between these bubbles and the aura circles is that aura circles are usually one circle meanwhile the bubbles are meant to compliment the waves of the prototypes.
Drawing to the theoretical framework the prototype can be analyzed through an example of the net art from Rhizome’s website which is called the simple net art diagram which I researched on Week 2. (Rhizome, 2016)Just like this artwork, my prototype has the ability to be transferred from different types of technology such as laptops and cellphones. It can be viewed from the laptop through the website link and because it is saved on Krita as a png image therefore it has two different visual representations. A png image and interactive artwork on the react app. This prototype can be imported on the website, and it can be posted onto social media using the png image. The social media platforms I am referring to are Instagram and Twitter. Another form of visual representation is that the png image can be posted as a video on these social media platforms with music in the background. Internet artwork as no physical copy and therefore can have multiple copies once imported and posted on the internet. I state this because most artworks that are posted social media can be screenshotted and posted in different accounts for promotion and recognition depending on if those accounts give the right credits to the artists but I believe the cons of other accounts posting the png image of the internet artwork is that some accounts might take credit of the artwork which is why I believe is important to sign your artwork with a signature that you use. I believe that internet artwork does have an aura or sense of emotion to the viewer, but it can bring different effects. Internet art is considered a new form of artwork I state this because most artworks are easily accessed using technology such as laptops and cell phones.
 Because this prototype is only available on the react app and in the asset file of the react app folder in visual studio code it is not as easily accessible to the internet artworks as most are. According to Danae this author believes that the internet has a huge influence in our daily lives I believe in this statement because today’s generation finds different ways to use the internet to communicate with family and friends and meet strangers on social media platforms such as Instagram and twitter. But it is not just for communication. The internet is also used to keep up with the news around the world and it is also used to be aware of political, social, and economical views that are happening in the country. A few examples I can give of this is the KZN floods may people who have family or friends in the province of KwaZulu Natal are aware of the floods and because of the news on social media using the world wide web it will make people contact their loved ones. I believe that also influences the art world in different ways as people can use the web to find inspiration for their own artwork pieces and create new pieces. There is access to different drawing applications in order to create different artworks which can be considered a technical canvas for artists in the art world to draw on. 
Websites can be viewed as art galleries on the world wide web as well as use for artistic research and promotion.
