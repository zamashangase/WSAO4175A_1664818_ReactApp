    <h2>Week2: Web/Net Art</h2>
    <p>
    This analysis uses the critical and theoretical work to analyze the following web art. The artwork that I have chosen is from Rhizome’s website about the net art anthology. The artwork is called the simple net art diagram.(Rhizome, n.d.) According to the readings on the work of art has two different representations of visual artworks. (Danae & Chatel, 2019)  The artwork on the website, represents the ability for artwork to be shown in different technology including laptops and shows the cord is where all artwork gets transferred. (Rhizome, n.d.). The only way to see artwork nowadays is online, including artistic events such as art exhibitions in galleries and museums online. You can do this without leaving your studies or leave your desk. (Carrier, 2020). Visual artworks on the internet do not have an aura but this aura is replaced with effective replacements of multiple copies of the original artwork. (Carrier, 2020). An example of this is the access that the internet gives us to the seeing different famous artworks such as the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh’s Starry Night, and other famous masterpieces. The main page of Rhizome has other visual artworks whereas the previous website I mentioned has more of an explanation on how net art is available on the internet. The main page provides different artworks by different artists for viewers to see and discover. An example of artwork from the website is an artwork called Amorphoscapes II by Stanza which was created in 1997.(Stanza, 1997) The artwork series was active from 1997-2004. The artworks were touch screen editions. These artworks remind me of the art style Vincent Van Gogh incorporated into his famous art pieces specifically in his backgrounds of these art pieces. (Stanza, 1997). 
    
</p>
<p>
Internet art is considered a new visual art form that has been created. This website is an example of an internet galleries collecting different artworks. (Carrier, 2020). The internet is now a new home for artistic criticism. Commentaries are now available for artwork and can be posted for the artist and others to view.
</p>
<p>
According to Danae, the web has an influence in the art world because the internet now has a huge impact in our daily lives.(Danae & Chatel, 2019) It has the importance of internet culture and artistic creation. Post internet art has a sister phrase which is called “art after the internet” that helps find what stands out on the internet. Since the production are pieces, she considers standing out. For the Rhizome website different art pieces on the website will only stand out depending on different people who view because everyone is different. Different pieces will feel different or catch the attention of different viewers. There is a new phase of internet art associated with aesthetics which in these days are popular on social media for artists and creatives as they create whatever they are feeling and incorporate in different artistic ways. Aesthetics are kind of like a theme and there are various options to choose from. Aesthetics in this phrase according to the reading merges the virtual and physical style of the internet.  Aesthetics in this case also refers to a subject and their visual outlook. Aesthetics has reviewed the internet with the rhizomatic structure it possesses. (Danae & Chatel, 2019)
</p>

    <h3>Week 2: Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      In my reflection my understanding of this theoretical framework is that the art world is expanding in the world wide web. I believe that the internet
      is a visual representation of artwork as stated I believe that the world wide web is either a canvas for artists to create their artwork or show it to the world.
      Most internet artworks can be one visual representtion as they are found on the internet but we also have access to download these images and create multiplr copies.
      These multiple copies can be physical copies as we print the copies. Web art can be either one or two visual representations depeending on the access one has to the 
      artwork. The artist can lock the art piece in order for viewers to have access to view the net art but cannot copy and paste for themselves. In my opinion this could be
      because of the value of the artwork. An example I can use for this statement is NFTs and how people have to pay in order to fully view the net artwork.
      another example of why some web arts cannot be downloaded is because there are peple who download or screenshot the artwork and take credit for the work
      especially the web art is increasing in value or high in demand. Some visual artwork do not have auras on the internet because it depends on the viewers themselves.
      For example the internet artwork I chose for the internet art preparatory work has a calming effect of emotions for me but does not have the same effect on other people
      The same artwork could not trigger the same emotions or feelings. I used examples of famous artworks because there are different types of copies of these art pieces on social
      media and Google. Artists can edit the original work of the orginal artists and create some completely different for themselves using editing tools and apps such as photoshop.
      The Rhizome website in my opinion is a good example of a website filled with different web art. I also believe the esthetics of the website for Rhizome is because the artworks 
      are simple so therefore the website is simple itself in order to match aesthetics.
      In conclusion I believe that web art is a new form of art that is easier to access than most visual artworks that you find in galleries because you do not have to leave your house to
      research these pieces or go to the place where the artwork is displayed if you want to do research because it is all in technology nowadays. But some people do not agree with this method
      and they would rather view physical artwork by themselves because of their love for art and that is okay.

      <h2>Week4: My Critical Analysis</h2>
      <h3>My Research:</h3>
      <p>
      There is this website on UX design that talks about aesthetic design. This website talks about how design aesthetics
are more than visual sight. Aesthetics are part of our senses. The first sense is Sight, this is the most used out of
all the senses, we as observers cannot stop looking at something that we perceive as beautiful. An example I can make 
of this is artwork or the design of a product such as perfume. A website can be perceived as beautiful as well because
of the style guide and the colour scheme. This requires design planning.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second sense is Hearing/Sound. The reason this sense is used in aesthetic design is because sound is needed
    for background music and the ability to listen to videos.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third sense is Touch. This is used for the material of the product such as texture and weight,
    shape and texture. This is used for the physical material of the product which is being sold on the website.

  </p>
  <p>
    The last one is Taste and Smell. This is important in the food industry which is why food companies
    need the visual images of the product to get the customers and viewing audience to get hungry and 
    want to taste the product because of the way it is displayed. Visual representation is important because
    if the product looks amazing then it will attract the taste and smell sense. Some videos on websites have 
    tutorials on how to make the food or product which activates the hearing sound

      </p>
      <p>
 In this analysis we will be discussing the core principles of design and aesthetics. In terms of the 
principles of design, designers are aware of the invisible design elements. This principal idea is used 
for net art. It focuses on the art on the net rather than it being a space that is defined. It is not 
considered a space that people can enter through the browser. This has led to approaches that created 
codes such as ASCII code which implies the hidden and invisible elements behind the screen, although 
these elements are considered important during the creation of the visual elements and outcomes in 
art. An example that can be used is something similar to JODI. 

  </p>
  <p>
  It creates an art form using forms on 
the net such as rect button, text field button and radio button. This form of art is thought to be 
considered a new art form that believes that this art form gives the possibilities to any artist and 
designer for self-expression. Forms are seen as tools and design components to give artists and 
designers optional items that can be used for its ‘users. These optional items are also used to recreate 
and reuse as a form of art through the functional and visual features and the designing approaches in 
form art. The design responds to the feature of the net art and is only created for the net.
  </p>
  <p>
  The internet
itself is considered a canvas for net art so that the component for the internet such as media and it 
can be a design component for the design element in terms of the user experience. (Park, 2007). The 
principle of design elements has no weight and has completed the net art so that it can process the 
goal of the internet art. The existence of internet art forms itself through the participation of the users,
the relationship between the users and the designers is transformable and symbiotic. (Park, 2007). 

  </p>
  <p>
  According to Thorlacius, the role of aesthetics in web designs. The renewed discussion focuses on the 
aesthetics effects in web design, there are reasons for this. One of the reasons is the fast development 
and technology is viewed as a foundation for aesthetic experience. The functions of the web design 
aesthetics have a shift towards its style and eventually has growth. (Thorlacius, 2007). Aesthetics have 
a different approach and has different types of roles in websites. It takes concern on how the sender 
is perceived aesthetics are seen through images, these images are used for information that is useful 
for industries and companies. Website’s aesthetics include different information that are functional, 
linguistic, and aesthetic effects. Aesthetics support the content and functional aspects of the websites.
Aesthetics in websites isfriendly to the users depending on what the user is looking for in the websites 
including the users interests and needs. Aesthetics also have to adapt to different genres, genres such 
as art, entertainment, comedy, research, and other genres. This is because aesthetics matches the 
effects and adapt to the audience. It has to be pleasing to the audience for example, a fashion website 
for designers, fashion lovers and women and men that have an interest in fashion design or the fashion 
and modelling world. The most successful websites have their own aesthetic appeal that attracts their 
target audience. There are four areas in this category which are: images, the sender, functionality and 
genre and target audience. (Thorlacius, 2007)
  </p>


  <h3>Week 4:Reflection</h3>
<p>
  In my reflection I believe that design and aesthetics are important. This is because the design elements 
  and aesthetics play a role in implementing the net art onto the internet so it can be net artwork. In my opnion my
  example from week 2 of the rhizome website is an example of people needing to use browser or google in order to find these
  net or web art. Code plays a role in the design process because I think is a part of the design elements in order for the net art to be 
  displayed onto the internet. Net art is a form of self-expression which is a part of being an artist, implementing your moods or how you feel into your
  artwork. An example I can make is from experience is how I incorporate music and musicians into my digital artworks because their songs ar my mood or how
  I am feeling at the moment and using different types of symbols with the artwork. Then I post the artwork on social media such Instagram and Twitter so my artwork can
  be on the internet. There are alot of artists that do this. The design component is seen on the websites of art galleries and other types of websites that match the 
  aesthetics which is why I believe that colour is important. This is good for the user experience. I do agree with Thorlacius that aesthetics are also important.
  In this generation believe it or not but aesthetics on social media is important because people either want to have an aesthetic that makes their target audience on 
  social media more engaged and active but some aesthetics are so popular that it tends to make the content creator lack any creativity. I believe that most artists want 
  to be different so therefore it is okay to experiment with different aesthetics as long as you are happy with your content. Instagram posts are an example of aesthetics
  by using images so it can attract an audience or brands and companies. An example I can use is when artists post their artwork onto social media or when a beauty influencer
  takes pictures of themselves and if they have a huge following or if the images are creative then the brands notices them and gives them more recogonition by posting them on their
  social media pages that have a massive amount of following. Another example of different aeshetics I gave are the use of different colours to make aestheitcs more cohorodented and 
  professional or if the aestheitcs is based on interests of the content creator then researching images for inspiration is a root I recommend.

  <h2>Week6:Internet, Society And Design Justice</h2>
  <section className='Blog-Text' style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${weekSixpage})`}}>
  <p>
In this summary we will be discussing the readings about internet, society, and design as well as a reflection of these three topics. Firstly, we will be discussing the topic about the Internet using readings. The reading for the Internet topic will be The Need for Global Internet Connectivity. The internet can be found in physical locations, and it can bring different people together as well as contact people with loved ones. It helps people find different businesses that specializes in their interests and needs. You can also discover different places with the internet using Google and Chrome. Although isolation is a problem in terms of socializing and preventing cultures from being recognized from the rest of the world. But there are areas such as rural areas that do not have access to the internet and suffer from this type of isolation. (Daniolou, 2020).
  </p>
  <p>
  In my opinion the 2020 lockdown did make a large amount of people use technology to access the internet and contact their loved ones by using apps such as WhatsApp and Instagram in order to message and video call people they could not see physically. But those living in rural areas had limited access to contact their loved ones without specific technology.
 There are several governments and private companies and non-governments and organizations that use the internet as an opportunity to advertise their businesses. In terms of businesses, the internet has a positive effect on the economy, the education, the businesses, and healthcare of those who live in the rural areas. Therefore, the internet can be used as marketing business ventures that help and supply those who do not have access or knowledge of the internet. As technology is always developing therefore the rural internet access will evolve along with it. (Daniolou, 2020). The internet is used as a form of online communication which can be used for an emergency to those who are living far away from each other. The emergency can be emotional or physical crisis. There are advantages to the internet such as google search, mobile libraries and broadband users can of course learn about news, fashion, politics, and science. There are no restrictions. (Daniolou, 2020). Although the internet has great power there is also dangers to the internet which can do more harm than good. Online information can be misleading, and the population can be manipulative for example, misleading articles about a politic topic or a certain celebrity the reason for these actions towards the media is that it will give more attention to the media brand as well as get people to view their website. This is considered “clout chasing” or “clickbait” in this generation where articles or people on the internet mislead people in order to get attention even if it means damaging someone’s reputation or career. It also has a harm towards social groups by those who pretend to be something they are not in order to kidnap young girls and women which is seen in the dark web and Tinder Swindler. (Daniolou, 2020). 
  </p>
  <p>
  I believe that parents should be aware and keep their children aware of the dangers of the internet as well as having a parental view to see if they are not doing anything that will get their children victims to dangerous people on the internet.
As for society we will be using the reading by Tataki and Glynos. The reading begins with the mentioning of students that had to adapt to the global pandemic and how some children were not able to attend physical classes by 50%. The solution for the absence of children in classroom while attending online classes were platforms such as Funzi. In our case their apps such as Teams and uLwazi which helped students that attend online classes. It also makes it easy for those students’ who live in different provinces. These applications helped with having contacting teachers and made it easier for students to contact their teachers when having a problem although it took some time to adjust. In my opinion online learning has now become a normal part of today’s society as we had to adapt to the global pandemic. Even aside from online learning there are some jobs where people are having meetings online rather than face to face just to be safe and some companies are still strict on the Covid-19 protocols. But there are still disadvantages for high income countries as their children have to adapt with the web application especially when they are not used to it. For example, there were students with courses that did not require a laptop at first until the pandemic and were struggling to adapt or afford one. Some universities managed to make applications for those who did not have computers at home. (Tataki & Glynos, 2020).
  </p>
  <p>
  The next topic is about design and in my opinion the design department is important in business companies because without design there is no advertisement which will catch the attention of the businesses target audience and target market. Designers are responsible for brand logos, websites and advertisements which help with recognition of the brand and help target audiences become well known. Design justice is seen as a framework that recognizes that design is a human activity. Design is about making a plan, problem solving and making a mark. The reading mentions the sexism in the workplace where professional design jobs are given to males than females. Professional design jobs in different work fields are allocated to people with high located privileges. Designers are highly rewarded both culturally and economically. There are different designers that are people of colour that are not fully recognized. (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
        
  </p>
  <h3>Week 6: Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    In my reflection for week 6. In my opinion the internet does bring people together to a certain extent some poeple do not want to be on the internet and rather experience physical contact from people and real communication
    but in this day and age having any form of technology in order to contact people is consider an essential to human survival if you stay or are visiting remote areas or if you live far away from your loved ones and need to contact
    them. Internet is now a place where you can get information on different subjects, people can se it for research on topics or events that are acquiring in the world or search for a job. That is why i believe it is a positive effect
    on the economy except for those who do not have a mobile phone or laptop in order to do the research. In terms of healthcare I believe the internet is helpful in terms of searching for the nearest hospital in casesof emergencies. An example I can 
    make if this is the KZN floods many people had to be taken to the hospitals due to severe injuries.
    Most companies nowadays post employment requirements in order to hire people. I believe in this generation that society is very dependant on the internet or some sort of
    technology in order to get news or do research especially as students. Another example I can make on technology that is used to inform society is the television. News reports,
    news channels and others are  used for displaying information besides entertainment.

  <h2>Internet Art-Preparatory Work</h2>
  <section className='Blog-Text' style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${internetartbyZama})`}}>
  <p>
  I was looking into colour for the theme of the website and researching different types of colours that compliment each other without clashing with each other. I researched that colour have a representation of different websites and how people view it. These selected colours give off a cool and calm sense or a soft type of vibe. 
  The Internet Artworks I have chosen are specifically is because of the aura i felt when I saw these specific artworks. The visual representation of the internet artwork and the website as a whole is the colour theme and in the style guide.
  the specific colour theme is the dusty pink background and the dark purplish pink as the header seemed to work the best from the inspiration of sources in the internet artwork and the 
  wireframes. With the wireframes sicne this is my first app I did not want to go overboard and drew simple wirefames at first so it is easier to see my work. This is my one of my techincal concerns 
  another one is the fact that is my first app I am not sure which visual content to take besides the blogs and internet artwork and since this is an internet artwork theme assignment I thought it was best
  to have a gallery inspired type of app design. These designs from the websites I have visited have an simply type of aesthetic because the artworks themselves should capture the viewers attention with the colours of the websites.

  overpowering or distracting the viewer from the artworks. Which is why there is bright blues and I also thought of eye senstitivity to bright colours.
  Before doing the wireframes, I was doing research on internet art website in the module section. I did this research for reference and have a clue on what the visual designs are like. For example, the website called Net Art Anthology and the Rhizome webpage. (Rhizome, 1999).

  <h2>Week8: My Internet Artwork Prototype Discussion</h2>
  <section className='Blog-Text' style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${internetartbyZama})`}}>
  <p>
  My internet artwork prototype is different shades of pink and different shades of purple coming together to create this piece. I created this piece using Krita the drawing app. I started with using light pinks and light purples for the ends of the two corners. But these lines and shades do not touch each other clash instead it is meeting a group of circles that were drawn using a messy brush. Each circle is in groups and in three different colours.
This artwork prototype functions as an artwork because it is inspired by the source inspiration of my internet artwork preparatory work. This different lines of pink and purple inspired this specific prototype but the lines I created has the intention to create different lines that look very similar to waves or look like waves in general. The reason behind this is the way waves have a calm effect and I wanted to implement that effect through different colours instead blue, so it is not too obvious and the prototype airs out a bit mystery. The colours do look a bit similar to the colours from the source of inspiration. The source of inspiration internet artworks reminded me of auras which is spiritual and calming and uses colours to give a calming effect to the mind. While researching auras I noticed that most of the artworks for auras are circles with one or two colours surrounding each other. With the idea of auras being drawn in circles the prototype artwork has circles which are in groups. One group are purple circles, and the other is a group of pink circles. The circles I created are actually bubbles which is why some of them are small and others ae big. The difference between these bubbles and the aura circles is that aura circles are usually one circle meanwhile the bubbles are meant to compliment the waves of the prototypes.
Drawing to the theoretical framework the prototype can be analyzed through an example of the net art from Rhizome’s website which is called the simple net art diagram which I researched on Week 2. (Rhizome, 2016)

I believe my problem with the technical challenge is making the artwork interactive so far. I believe I can try to find a way around it.
  </p>
  <p>
  Just like this artwork, my prototype has the ability to be transferred from different types of technology such as laptops and cellphones. It can be viewed from the laptop through the website link and because it is saved on Krita as a png image therefore it has two different visual representations. A png image and interactive artwork on the react app. This prototype can be imported on the website, and it can be posted onto social media using the png image. The social media platforms I am referring to are Instagram and Twitter. Another form of visual representation is that the png image can be posted as a video on these social media platforms with music in the background. Internet artwork as no physical copy and therefore can have multiple copies once imported and posted on the internet. I state this because most artworks that are posted social media can be screenshotted and posted in different accounts for promotion and recognition depending on if those accounts give the right credits to the artists but I believe the cons of other accounts posting the png image of the internet artwork is that some accounts might take credit of the artwork which is why I believe is important to sign your artwork with a signature that you use. I believe that internet artwork does have an aura or sense of emotion to the viewer, but it can bring different effects. Internet art is considered a new form of artwork I state this because most artworks are easily accessed using technology such as laptops and cell phones.
 Because this prototype is only available on the react app and in the asset file of the react app folder in visual studio code it is not as easily accessible to the internet artworks as most are. According to Danae this author believes that the internet has a huge influence in our daily lives I believe in this statement because today’s generation finds different ways to use the internet to communicate with family and friends and meet strangers on social media platforms such as Instagram and twitter. But it is not just for communication. The internet is also used to keep up with the news around the world and it is also used to be aware of political, social, and economical views that are happening in the country. A few examples I can give of this is the KZN floods may people who have family or friends in the province of KwaZulu Natal are aware of the floods and because of the news on social media using the world wide web it will make people contact their loved ones. I believe that also influences the art world in different ways as people can use the web to find inspiration for their own artwork pieces and create new pieces. There is access to different drawing applications in order to create different artworks which can be considered a technical canvas for artists in the art world to draw on. 
Websites can be viewed as art galleries on the world wide web as well as use for artistic research and promotion.

  <h2>Assignment1: My Reflection</h2>
  <p>
  Assignment 1 for me was a bit tricky for the technical part because of a few laptop issues with uploading and creating a react app and I had to improvise and create an html website to submit in order for the other requirements for the assignments could be fulfilled. The theory blogs and the design section were done as well as being able to upload images of the design process. But the theory section was interesting and fun to engage with. I just had a problem with continuing with my explanations and examples. The creative part was also fun for me because I was experimenting with colours and seeing if they complimented each other, or it was too for me at the time or if the colours with fighting with each other because end of the day the website has to focus on the information provided. My wireframes were simple because I tend to take baby steps, but the technical part was very challenging for me.
  </p>
  <h2>Assignment2: My Reflection</h2>
  <p>
  Assignment 2 for me was also tricky at the beginning in terms of the technical part but with the help of Andre’s tutorials and Andre himself I slowly started to get the hang of things although this is my first react app, so it was a bit challenging for me because some code did not want to work, and some code did. I feel as if I am slowly getting the hang of things. For the theoretical part which was the internet art preparatory work I was google and search for internet art on Pinterest because I wanted an idea for what to do and how I want the app to compliment the internet artwork from the source inspiration. The pieces I had be drawn to in my prepatory work had a sense of auras and give me positive kinds of feelings when I saw them which is exactly how artwork is supposed to make you feel. Artwork is supposed to give a sense of emotion and remind you of something. Although a colour that appears to give me peace can also give a different effect on the viewer. For example, I know some people might not like pink cause colour can be associated with past experiences and a sense of nostalgia. But also, the website is supposed to be an artwork itself and using the source inspiration from the preparatory work as an inspiration for the colour scheme I believe it is just that. Also, I used a similar colour scheme from Assignment 1 because looking and observing the first artwork piece that ascends from a sea of different pinks to a sea of different purples seems interesting to me. I used the word seas because when looking into this internet artwork piece it reminded of waves.

  <h2>New Design Reflection:</h2>
  <h3>Wireframes Process:</h3>
  <p>
    For my new design for my website I drew new wireframes while creating the website
    The original wireframes are included in the process of designing the website.
    There is a second set of wireframes that I created before going with a different
    approach for the final wireframes that have been drawn for the react website. There are offically
    three different sets of wireframes for the website.
  </p>
  <h3>Images and Creative Process:</h3>
  <p>
For my new design reflection I decided to look for internet artworks that match the style guide 
of my website and turn them into backgrounds to add a creative compontent for the website so
each website is not plain or boring. The font colour is black so the background images do not overpower
the text. The specific artworks I had chosen were Auras with the style guide because of my fascination with
spiritual energy I also wanted the viewers to feel the same when viewing this website through the visual images.
This idea came from one of the assigned readings from the semester. The reason I have used these aura images to enchance 
my website in terms of my internet art is because aura internet artwork is the original inspiration for my internet artwork
which is also in the internet artwork section of the website. The preparatory artwork is a background to avoid scrolling too
much and also to incorporate the my internet artwork being incorporated into the website aesthetics.

  </p>
  <p>
    According to Carrier, visual artworks on the internet do not have an aura but these images disproves that theory
    in my opinion because they were created and inspired by artists that believe in spiritual energies and that colours give 
    people different feelings about the web art. Carrier states this because of the mutliple copies found from in the internet.
    I used these aura images for the blog posts section and the design section. 
  </p>
  <h4>Other Creatives:</h4>
  <p>
    I added a footer because it was not added to website in previous assignments and left the website unfinished.
    I chose two different colours for the website, black and white so the website can be creative and not boring.
    Also I did not want to use any other colour besides these colours to avoid the font colours conflicting with the images 
    and colour scheme of the website.
  </p>
  <h4>Reflection:</h4>

    According to Danae, an article by Marie Chatel. Rhizome had launched an exhibition called
    "The Art Happens Here". This exhibition has showcased sixteen different artists and contains
    over 100 pieces that was organized and restored over the years.  (Danae & Chatel, 2019)Rhizome made this website so 
    it can be a network media that is present. In my opinion, Rhizome's exhibition is like an
    internet gallery that provides the selected artists a given platform to display their artworks. (Danae & Chatel, 2019)
     Olia Lialina who is a 1990s artist was concerned about artistic languages and incporating it 
     into the internet. She curated content into the internet that was available online. (Danae & Chatel, 2019). The word 
     content is the information that contains media. This includes the internet, television,visual art and other technology.

  </p>
  <p>
    The content in the website is the images of different aura internet artworks that is found on the internet and placed 
    in a website that can also be a platform or exhibition for internet artworks to be displayed.
    This is like an art gallery on the internet with information and a form of communication.
  </p>
  <p>
    This research and reading inspired the incorporation of adding the aura internet arts I have hand picked
    from different artists and incorported in different parts of the website so the viewers can see different 
    net art. The footer was added because the website looked unfinished but while incorporating this. The website
    and the foter contains business related purposes to be seem professional and have information. This is incorporated
    through the design.

    While researching for design and aesthetics for this project I came across a website on ux design.
    According to the website, there is this effect called the Halo Effect that also applies to products and 
    websites. The Halo Effect is when people tend to assume that attractive looking people have other qualities
    besides their looks. This applies to aesthetic designs and websites. This researched was applied to my websites
    by displaying different internet artworks as the "product" and it is a part of the design aesthetics as it is 
    used as background images when discussing different topics. Here is the link for the website: (https://uxdesign.cc/design-principle-aesthetics-af926f8f86fe)

  <h2>New Technical Reflection:</h2>
  <p>
    For my technical reflection since the first assignment up till now I have been 
    working and getting used to the technical part of the React app. 
  </p>
  <h3>Reflection and Research:</h3>
  <p>
    The theory of two works of art being visual representation in net art can be seen
    in different formats. The technical component for the website allows the viewer
    to have access to read and view the website in different screens. For example, the
    technical component of responsive design on html and CSS. I am saying this because with 
    this technical compontent can be viewed on computers and mobile phone screens. This technical
    component can also be used in React. During my research I found a website about different artists
    incorporating technical HTML and React components for their artwork which is similar to the creation
    of this website. The website I am refering to is Net Art by the Monoskop organization. The similarity traits
    include social media API or incorporated icons which are displayed on my footer. I added YouTube and Instagram
    because I was mainly thinking of social media icons people around my age mostly engage in. There are different 
    internet mediums that are considered Art just like the website using components such as HTML, CSS, Net-based artworks
    which I used to in different creative ways to be displayed onto my website by using them as background images or source 
    of inspiration. The use of Javascript is heavily used on this website to create alot of data, information and images fo the
    net art. An example of artists I can refer to on this website that I have come across that have used similar 
    as me to create artwork and websites are Rafael Rozendaal and Douglas Davis.(https://monoskop.org/Net_art)
  </p>
  <p>
    This components and CSS and HTML functionc make it possible for my website internet artworks to be displayed.
    The technical components of code were heavily needed on my website by using React library functions in order for
    my evidence of research and different internet artwork and images that I have created and used for this website to be 
    displayed. Creativity can only be displayed through thee website by using technical coding.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to Daniolou, the internet has an important role towards business that's why when developing
    a website it is best to add a footer with contact and content information. Using the technical components
    of javascript and JSX index I managed to create a footer with information and email subscription on the website
    to keep viewers updated. It helps advertise businesses on the internet and promote internet artwork in my website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Danilou's article on The Need for Global Internet Connectivity mainly focuses on the internet access in rural areas.
    With React if there is no internet on unpublished React website then the viewer can not view the website until the internet
    connection is available again. From my experience, bad wifi has caused the access to the React App to be limited or unreachable.
    Once the website is deployed and published then the viewers with internet access can see the developed website.
    From my experience, I had to use command prompt to have access to my React website when my laptop lost internet connection.
    Although the difference between my experience and reading is the area codes and locations.
